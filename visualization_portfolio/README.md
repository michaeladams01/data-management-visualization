# Visualization Portfolio

This directory contains visual analytics projects for the Data 620 course. Each subfolder holds exported Tableau dashboards and/or Python scripts that recreate interactive charts.

## Contents

- **Dashboards**: Exported images or PDFs of Tableau dashboards demonstrating time-series analysis, categorical comparisons, and narrative storytelling using StoryPoints.
- **Python Visualizations**: Example scripts written in Python (matplotlib/plotly) that reproduce selected dashboards for code-based demonstrations.

## Overview

The dashboards illustrate key principles of data visualization such as:

- Effective use of color and layout to convey trends and outliers.
- Combining multiple charts into coherent stories.
- Interactive filters and parameters to enable deeper exploration.

Data sources are either synthetic or drawn from public datasets (e.g., sample sales or financial data). Each visualization is accompanied by a brief description explaining the goal and the insights uncovered.
